# Raison d'être

This website serves as a way to _express myself artistically_ and technically — _much like a blank canvas._ <br />

Despite not being a designer, I have a keen interest in visual arts; pursuing _beauty and functionality_ is my goal.

# Intrinsics

Before delving into the technicalities, I would like to mention my _biggest inspirations_ for this website:

- [Igor Bedesqui](https://igorbedesqui.com) for [“Schrödinger's Minimalism”](https://igorbedesqui.com/writing/schrodinger-minimalism)
- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com/) for their visual arts and approach to documentation
- [Conrad Crawford](https://cnrad.dev) for his great portfolio

# Typefaces

- [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson for headings
- [Libre Franklin](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Franklin) by Pablo Impallari for body text

# Tooling

The website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). <br />
The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

# Ad futurum

> _A Latin phrase_ meaning “for the future.”

I plan to build a _knowledge base_ by documenting my projects, thoughts, and experiences, as well as a _portfolio_ showcasing my artistic and technical endeavours.

Over the years, I hope for this website to become a _time capsule of my growth and development_—a reflection of my past, present, and future self.
