# Why do I need these rules?

Working on the basis of full transparency regarding my necessities is a great filter when looking for the right people; I enjoy building things and enjoy even more the process of building an infrastructure to build things on.

Thus, [the limits of my language mean the limits of my world](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5475578-5-6-the-limits-of-my-language-mean-the-limits-of), one is free to collaborate with me on any of my projects, so long as they share the same views.

# Regulae sacrae

> A Latin phrase meaning "Sacred Rules"

Every single one of my projects, to an extent, have a standardized set of tooling one will have to learn and use to collaborate. Ethics and attitude also play a big part in it.

## [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) + [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)

I am a firm believer that good commit messages equal a better collaboration experience, be it in debugging, blaming, reverting, and so on.

It can be tedious, thus the usage of [convco](https://convco.github.io) is recommended but not required for committing to my repositories.

## [Conventional Branches](https://conventional-branch.github.io/)

Not much to say, refer to the previous heading.

## Ante agendum, dic

> A Latin phrase meaning "Before acting, tell"

Nobody enjoys merge conflicts, diverging histories, force-pushes, and such.

And quite frankly, I would just prefer clear communication over doing whatever one feels like whenever one feels like.

## Adhere

I like linters and formatters. I like it even more when code is clean, elegant, and properly formatted.

I generally have hooks set up for Nix users, but if one does not use Nix, I always provide the tooling needed to format and/or lint the project in scripts.

Touching back on the previous paragraph:  
While I'm not personally a die-hard functional programming enthusiast, I would prefer elegant declarative approaches rather than abominable imperative ones.

## Do Not Argue Pointlessly

I like talking.  
I will listen to one's opinion patiently, weigh the pros and cons, and then decide whether it's a "yes" or a "no."

If I say no and give a reason for it, I really do not want to argue any more in bad faith — it just makes me not want to work with one. At all.

# Mutabilitas et Continuitas

> A Latin phrase meaning "Change and Continuity"

This post is subject to change and should be a constant personal reference.  
My way of working evolves, and so do my expectations. One should revisit this regularly if they intend to work with me long-term.
